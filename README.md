# Shortest Path Finder
A visualization of the following pathfinding algorithms:
* Lee
* Dijkstra
* A-star

Lee's algorithm works on grid-based maps and it relies on recursion. The other two use a weighted graph to find the optimal solution.

This is an example of Lee's algorithm:

This is an example of the A-star algorithm:
